This directory contains the what you need to make assignments and coding drills for CS 1030

# Instructions for making assignments.
You will need to run new_problem.sh with the following parameters
usage: new.sh <cs1030-assignments> <problemname> <basename>

Sample:
```

```
### Step 2 - After the problem is completed
For every problem you will also need to copy the <cs1030-template.cfg>.
This will just be a problem.

# Instructions for making coding drills

### Step 1
You will need to run new_problem_set.sh with the following parameters
usage: new.sh <cs1030-debugs> <problemsetname> <problemname> <basename>

Sample:
```
./new_problem_set.sh cs1030-debugs cs1030-mod4-debug cs1030-04-01-fix_indentation fix_indentation
```
### Step 2 - Starter
Put starter code in the starter file

### Step 3 - Doc
Sample Doc file
            # 4.2) Indentation with if-else

            This code should ask the user for their name and if their name comes before 'M' in 
            the dictionary then print 'Hello name' otherwise print 'Goodbye name'. 

            ### Fix the following syntax errors
            - Indentation 

### Step 4 - tests
1. Copy asttest.py to the test directory
2. Copy the solution code to the test directory
3. Put in the test code
    a. If there is input, use Tim's helper function: input_helper.py


### Step 5 - problem.cfg file
For every problem you will also need to copy the <cs1030-problem-template.cfg>.
This will just be a problem.
Example:
cp ~/cs1030-codegrinder/cs1030-template.cfg .

### Step 6 - grind create
If you are brave, run ```grind create``` to create the problem set on codegrinder

### Step 7 - problemset.cfg file
Setup: copy the <cs1030-problemset-template.cfg> to the problemset directory. 
            Example cs1030-debugs/cs1030-mod4-debug
1. Add the completed problem to the problem set (Do this by directory)
